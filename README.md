# GT3CourseArchiveEditor
Program to edit the course archive files found in Gran Turismo 3.
Allows unpacking and repacking course files.
Useful for isolating individual files for editing, &/ swapping files between courses. Deleting or adding new files is also possible.
Note, that this doesn't actually decompile or convert the various files inside the archive, instead it simply extracts the files themselves out/compiles files back into an archive.
